            <h1>BlobCapture</h1>
            <p>BlobCapture is a simple and efficient screenshot capture tool designed to quickly capture any selected region of your screen and store the image in a format that can be easily used for database storage. The tool is lightweight and user-friendly, making it perfect for developers or anyone who needs a fast way to capture and manage screenshots for database applications.</p>
            <p>If you need to convert the base64 encoded screenshots back into image format, you can use <a href="https://base64.guru/converter/decode/image" target="_blank">this website</a>.</p>
            <h2>Why I Built This Application</h2>
            <p>BlobCapture was created to simplify the process of handling images for database storage. Instead of saving screenshots to the file system and then uploading them to a database, this tool allows users to directly capture screenshots in a format that can be easily converted and stored as BLOBs in a database. This reduces the need for file management and makes database integration smoother, particularly for developers who need to manage images efficiently.</p>
            <h2>Target Audience</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Developers</strong> who work with database applications and need a quick and efficient way to manage screenshots.</li>
                <li><strong>Database Administrators</strong> looking to simplify the process of storing images in databases.</li>
                <li><strong>Data Analysts</strong> who want to document visual data directly into databases without file system dependencies.</li>
                <li><strong>General users</strong> who need an easy way to capture and prepare images for database use.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Key Features</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Capture any selected region of the screen.</li>
                <li>Copy the screenshot to the clipboard in Base64 format for easy use in databases.</li>
                <li>Designed to streamline image handling for database storage (BLOB format).</li>
                <li>Lightweight, user-friendly interface with a simple button to take screenshots.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Technologies Used</h2>

                <li><strong>Pillow</strong>: For image processing and screenshot capture functionality.</li>
                <li><strong>PyInstaller</strong>: Used to package the application as a standalone .exe file.</li>
                <li><strong>Base64 Encoding</strong>: For easy conversion of screenshots to formats suitable for database storage.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>How to Use</h2>
            <ol>
